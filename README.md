##### 👨🏻‍💻 Sobre o projeto
###### This project is a monitoring for a zabbix agent monitoring a rabbitmq, where there is a shellscript consuming the automatically installed API from the rabbitmq monitoring panel, a python file that reads all registered queues and prints how many messages have not yet been consumed
###### With this you can monitor if your rabbitmq consumer is working correctly
